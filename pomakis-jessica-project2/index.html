		<p>We are a couple friends with a love for good food and good company. We had been imagining our tavern for years, and when the building at the Seaport Station came up for lease, we knew it was time. Both of us has missed more trains than we care to admit, and always the memory that sticks out is: "jeez, I sure wish there was somewhere I'd feel comfortable just hanging out for a few hours while I wait for the next one." So here we are. We strive to be a safe haven for anyone and everyone, a place to meet up with someone coming into town, a place to wait a few hours until the next train, or even just a favorite place in town to grab a drink or dinner with some pals. We wanted a universal sort of place that could appeal to all sorts of people and that's what the End of the Line is. We hope to see you soon!</p>
		<h3>But don't take it from us, here's what our customers say!</h3>

		<blockquote> "End of the Line has been the best place to hang out, great food, great service, just love this place!" <br /> Jen, Minneapolis </blockquote>
		<blockquote> "My wife and I came here on a whim after coming in to King's Point on the train. We couldn't be more happy that we did. It's become our go-to spot whenever we come to town." <br /> Brian, Maine</blockquote>
